# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#  Patient.create(first_name: "Renad", last_name: "Alobaid", diagnosis: "sick", born_on: "31/3/2020")
#  Patient.create(first_name: "Afnan", last_name: "Mt", diagnosis: "sick", born_on: "31/3/2019")
#  Patient.create(first_name: "Reem", last_name: "Ab", diagnosis: "flu", born_on: "31/3/2066")
