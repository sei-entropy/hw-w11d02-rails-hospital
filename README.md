# Hospital App

Your homework for today is to practice! You're gonna create an app with one model `Patient`.

- Walk back through all the lessons so far. Create a new Rails app called `hospital-app`. Instead of `Todo` you'll create an `Patient` model. 

- You'll need to add your own  data for the Patients using a Seed file.

- Use what've learned in the class along with looking things up though the [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) and the [Rails API Docs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/) to help you complete the app.

- Complete all the user stories mentioned below.

### User Stories
rails g model Patient first_name last_name diagnosis born_on
- Version 1
  - As a user, I want to view a single patient
  - As a user, I want to view all patients
  - As a user, I want to create a patient with a first name, last name,
    diagnosis and born on
  - As a user, I want to edit a patient's first name, last name, diagnosis and
    born on
  - As a user, I want to delete a patient
